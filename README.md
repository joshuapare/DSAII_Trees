# DSAII_Trees

This is an exercise to demonstrate the function and searching algorithms for trees and binary search trees, using Python.

These data structures and algorithms were originally learned in Javascript, but given the prevelance of Python in data science, recreating them in Python will help with further understanding of syntax in future data science roles.
